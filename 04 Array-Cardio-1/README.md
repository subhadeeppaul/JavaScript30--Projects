# Things I learned -

- We can make neat and useful oneliners using arrow functions.
- `map()` and `sort()` will always return the same amount of items.
- ‘accumulator’ is just a fancy word for ‘total’ in the `reduce()` method.
- An initial value is pretty important in the `reduce()` method.
- How 1 and -1 work in the `sort()` method.
