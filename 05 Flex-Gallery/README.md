## Things I learned -
- `this-classList-toggle` can be used to toggle between class to remove & add it.
- Learned about `transition` in CSS which used to give smooth transtion of property in given specified time.
- `element > *` means that the child of elements & * means to apply to all.
- `:root` means it selects the document's root element.
- There is box-shadow & text-shadow available in CSS.

## Some important things -
- We are mainly using Flexbox, which are 3 means inside that inside that.
- We have to do transition first increasing the box size & then show the text.
- We make specific classes for open & active & toggle them when the user clicks on it.

> This was pretty tough for me as it the nesting of flexbox & transition effect that I don't know much.
