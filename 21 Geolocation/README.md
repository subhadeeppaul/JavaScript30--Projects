# Geolocation
> The main problem of this is that it does not work on desktop. Mainly worked for smartphones & make sure to allow location on in everything to get it running.

## Things I learned
- This is the first project where I read documentation & understand it
- Learned about `navigator.geolocation` Web API
- Learned various things that are present in geolocation that can be used.
- They all serve over HTTPS so use localhost or other that is available.
- Get to know about `toFixed(digits)`

## Some important things
- Also added latitude & longitude
