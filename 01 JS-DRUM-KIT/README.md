# JavaScript Drum Kit 

## Things I learned -

- Use of `<kbd>` HTML tag.
- What are keycodes & how to use them.
- Tool Found: Nice tool for finding JavaScript event keycodes at [keycode.info](https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode)
- data-* attributes where * can be anything specified. They are like to store custom data on HTML itself.
- Use of rem for making some responsive & easier working in CSS. I knew but started using now.
- Use of attributes in giving class property in querySelector.

## Some important things -
- Whenever we play to play sound then we add playing class in HTML code then the transition effect happened there.
- After the transition is done we remove by transionend property.
- We use keydown event not keyup event as when the user want to press multiple times then it will not work as stated.
- We can play audio in JavaScript by just using `.play()`.
- We use window in JavaScript to capture key that are preseed not document.
- `audio.currentTime = 0` for rewinding sound. Use to prevent delaying sound. this is pretty important.
